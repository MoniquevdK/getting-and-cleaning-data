## ReadMe Course Project

This repo contains a R-script that first creates a directory in which the downloaded files are unzipped. The path to these files is used to read in the data to R. Then the data is transformed into a much smaller, and most of all, cleaner and tidier dataset. By running the R-script you obtain a new table in your directory, called 'TidyData.txt', that consists of the final cleaned dataset.
